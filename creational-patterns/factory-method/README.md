# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory method works just the same way: it defines an interface for creating an object, but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creation being deferred at run-time.

## Real Life Example

As a hiring manager, one would like to employ a full time employee or a part time employee depending on what position is available.

## When to use?

* When a class can't anticipate the type of the objects it is supposed to create.
* When a class wants its subclasses to be the ones to specific the type of a newly created object.
