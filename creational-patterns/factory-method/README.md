# Factory Method Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Real Life Example

Imagine you are constructing a house and you approach a carpenter for a door. You give the measurement for the door and your requirements, and he will construct a door for you. In this case, the carpenter is a factory of doors. Your specifications are inputs for the factory, and the door is the output or product from the factory.
