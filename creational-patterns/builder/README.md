# Builder Pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you produce different types and representations of an object using the same building process. Builder allows constructing complex objects step by step.

## Real Life Example

As a manufacturer of automatic tranmission cars, one can manufacture a car with various different aspects such as type of engine or number of seats but it will still remain an automatic transmission car.

## When to use?

When there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping.
