# Builder Pattern

This pattern allows a client object to construct a complex object by specifying only its type and content, being shielded from the details related to the object's representation.

## Real Life Example

As a manufacturer of automatic tranmission cars, one can manufacture a car with various different aspects such as type of engine or number of seats but it will still remain an automatic transmission car.

## When to use?

* The creation algorithm of a complex object is independent from the parts that actually compose the object.
* The system needs to allow different representations for the objects that are being built.
