# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype.

## Real Life Example

As a Nascar team, one would not like to modify the car that is being used by the team but rather a replica.

## When to use?

* Classes to be instantiated are specified at run-time.
* Avoiding the creation of a factory hierarchy is needed.
* It is more convenient to copy an existing instance than to create a new one.
