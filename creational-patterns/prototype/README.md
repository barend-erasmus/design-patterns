# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype design pattern is the one in question. It allows an object to create customized objects without knowing their class or any details of how to create them.

## Real Life Example

As a Nascar team, one would not like to modify the car that is being used by the team but rather a replica.

## When to use?

* Classes to be instantiated are specified at run-time.
* Avoiding the creation of a factory hierarchy is needed.
* It is more convenient to copy an existing instance than to create a new one.
