# Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns: it involves only one class which is responsible to instantiate itself, to make sure it creates not more than one instance; in the same time it provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Real Life Example

As a computer can only have one operating system running at a time but this operating system also needs to be accessible to all programs running.

## When to use?

* When there must be exactly one instance of a class, and when it must be accessible to clients from a global access point.
