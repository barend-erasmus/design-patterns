# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Real Life Example

Imagine you are constructing a house and you approach a carpenter for a door. You can go to a carpenter, or you can go to a plastic door shop or a PVC shop. All of them are door factories. Based on the situation, you decide what kind of factory you need to approach. This is like an Abstract Factory.
