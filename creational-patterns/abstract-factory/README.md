# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

## Real Life Example

As a phone distributer, one can buy dumb phones and smart phones from a manufacturer where the manufacturer could be Samsung or Vodaphone depending on the type of phone distributer you are.

## When to use?

When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved.
